ALGORITHM ANALYSIS: 

Assume v_0 vertices, e_0 edges, and t_0 triangles in the initial mesh,
k edges connected to each vertex (average or worst case),
reduced to t_final triangles using the -shortest criteria.

What is the overall order notation for the program?  Analyze the
separate compoenents of the program to justify your answer.

ALGORITHM ANALYSIS -- LINEAR:




ALGORITHM ANALYSIS -- PRIORITY QUEUE:





ALGORITHM ANALYSIS -- IMPACT OF -preserve_area command line argument?
Do your answers above change with or without the -preserve_area
command line argument?  Describe.






EXTRA CREDIT:  COLOR & OVERALL APPERANCE
Discuss the quality of your results in your README.txt and include
screenshots of your more impressive results.  If you have submitted
screenshots, give the file names and describe the results.



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!


Using two spaces for indentation is horrific. I don't know if the indents defaulting
to being spaces rather than tabs is you or just a quirk of downloading the files,
but I hate it and if it was intenional may Linux have mercy on your soul.

On another note, why the HELL are some methods written with the first letter capitalized?
Are they objects? Because that sure makes them look like objects. Goodness, if you're going
to insist on using foolish conventions, could you at least be consistent?



(By the way I hope the sarcasm in these comments is evident, I don't mean to be mean but
I need to maintain my will to live somehow, and it's quite fun).


So, in all seriousness I got very very sick today, and from where I stand right now I don't
think I'll be conscious long enough to finish. Enjoy what I did, I doubt it comes together enough
to be functional, but I at least did the work.
