ALGORITHM ANALYSIS: 

Assume v_0 vertices, e_0 edges, and t_0 triangles in the initial mesh,
k edges connected to each vertex (average or worst case),
reduced to t_final triangles using the -shortest criteria.

What is the overall order notation for the program?  Analyze the
separate compoenents of the program to justify your answer.
