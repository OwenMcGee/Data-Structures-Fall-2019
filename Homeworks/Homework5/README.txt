MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

I altered some bits of main.cpp that I technically wasn't supposed to, but only
to change the names of the methods and variables to the ones I used, tolerable
ones (I abhor your prolific use of underscores. Camel case is amazing and you
should use it, or continue on in shame of your sins).

Scratch that, submitty apparently throws a fit if I use reasonable method names.
I've made my names attrocious, you're welcome.
