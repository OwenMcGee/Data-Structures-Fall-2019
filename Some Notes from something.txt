Compile with: gcc -Wall -Werror file.c

-Wall = warnings all (prints all warnings)

-Werror = warnings as errors (treats all warnings as errors, and will stop running if a warning pops up)



-E = preprocessor only (won't produce an output file that can be run)



echo $? - gives you the return of the previously run statement (should be 0 if the program ran correctly)



to use the math libraary add "-lm" to the end of gcc




call "man # function" and it will show the manual for a given function




%3d prints doubles with a width of 3
$03d prints doubles with a width of 3, with spaces replaced with 0s
%20.15f prints floats to a width of 20 and a precision of 15 decimal points
(by default these adjust to the right, and if they hit the max width they keep going off to the right)
